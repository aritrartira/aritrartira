# About Aritra Chakraborty
I am a Computer Science and Engineering undergrad (2019-23) at [Jadavpur University Kolkata](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in). I wish to pursue a career in research. Currently, my interests primarily lie in Artificial Intelligence. As of the time of writing, I am studying Machine Learning. The theoretical and more mathematical side of ML has been fascinating and I hope to be a researcher in this field one day.
